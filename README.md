Welcome to the Oasis Infobyte Task 2 - Data Cleaning project README! This project focuses on cleaning and preparing data for analysis, ensuring that it is accurate, consistent, and ready for further processing. Whether you're a data scientist, analyst, or researcher, efficient data cleaning is essential for deriving meaningful insights and making informed decisions.

## Objective
The primary objective of this project is to perform comprehensive data cleaning tasks, including:
- Handling missing or null values
- Standardizing data formats
- Removing duplicates
- Correcting inaccuracies or inconsistencies
- Data validation and verification

## Technologies Used
- Programming Language: Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, etc.

## Getting Started
To begin cleaning the data, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/XBOY56/Oasis_infobyte_Task_2-DATA_CLEANING.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd Oasis_infobyte_Task_2-DATA_CLEANING`
3. Open the Python script or Jupyter Notebook containing the data cleaning tasks.

## Data Cleaning Process
1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Understand the structure, quality, and characteristics of the dataset through visualizations and summary statistics.
2. **Handling Missing Values:** Address missing or null values by imputation, deletion, or interpolation based on the nature of the data.
3. **Standardization and Transformation:** Standardize data formats, convert data types, and perform necessary transformations to ensure consistency.
4. **Removing Duplicates:** Identify and remove duplicate records to prevent redundancy and ensure data integrity.
5. **Correcting Inaccuracies:** Address any inaccuracies or inconsistencies in the data, such as typos, outliers, or incorrect entries.
6. **Data Validation:** Validate data against predefined rules or constraints to ensure its accuracy and reliability.

## Contributing
